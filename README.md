# Java While Loop Basics
---
## In this repo, there are five basic while loops for five different purposes: finding whether or not two numbers are evenly divisible, getting each digit of a number, getting the frequency of vowels in a sentence, getting the minimum and maximum from a set of values (or rather, a sequence), and getting the sum and average from a set of values/sequence.
## All five programs take in user input before executing their while loop.
